# Prediction-of-Hard-Disk-Failures
Hard-Disk failure prediction is a binary classification problem with labeling disks with one of two classes of failure or healthy. For this, we have used a machine learning approach to develop a model (based on Hard-disk dataset from Backblaze) which predicts if hard-disk is healthy or not based on the SMART variables of the Hard-disk.
